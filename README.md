# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

### Background

In this PyBer Analysis we will be creating dataframe of ride sharing data by city type. Also using Pandas and Matpotlib we will be creating multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Purpose

The purpose of PyBer Analysis to deliver,

* Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

* Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

* Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)

## Results:

The following key metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze some disparities in city types.

* From this dataframe we can see that Urban cities have the maximum number of rides and drivers and rural cities have the minimum. This shows that urber cities has more revenue and the rural cities has the lowest revenue.If we look at total fare column we can get the information about it.


* Average fare per ride amount for the rural cities is higher than the urban cities.

* Average fare per driver in rural cities is more than 3 time of the urban city driver fares.

* Average fare per ride and driver range for suburban cities is within rural and urban cities.

* If we monitor the line graph we can get idea about total fare for city types from Jan 2019 to April 2019. 



## Summary

### Recommendations

1. If we see the dataframe for rural area the average fare is higher and number of rides is lower so fare can be possible cause to avoid ride sharing so I would recommend reducing fare price and promoting the ride sharing business.

2. The driver fare amount is lower in urban area so I would recommend to check the root cause for having low fare amount. There is possibility of maximum number of drivers available in urban cities for shorter rides so if the driver takes longer rides to suburban or rural area fare could possibly increase.

3. I would also recommend having fixed fare for rides in all city type can also be helpful for business in order to grow number of rides and revenue.
